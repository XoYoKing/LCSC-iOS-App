Jake needs to...

BUGGSSSS

1. (done) Add Event View Controller - The start event time and end event time don't need checking if the days are different.

2. (done) Updating an event should send you all the way back to the calendar.

3. (done) After adding or updating an event the calendar should be refreshed.

4. (done) Lock the selection of days on the calendar if the calendar is loading.

5. (done) Smaller circles on iphone storyboard calendar.

6. (done) Days of the week labels on iphone storyboard calendar.

7. Push notification stuff...

8. (done) Updating an event should actually delete the old event.

9. (done) Reposition the labels for the Days of the week for the ipad storyboard.

10. The repeat and repeat until buttons will disappear after a warning alert shows up.

11. (done) The location isn't being saved when events are being added/updated.

12. (done) The repeat until is invalid when the day is less than the start day no matter the month/year.

13. (done) The activity indicator needs repositioned.

14. (done) Add Event button is showing up on the day event view controller for regular user.

15. (done) (apart of #14) Nevena got authorized for two calendars (athletics, campus rec.)

16. (done) Update Event won't delete old events.

17. (done) The delete event method isn't intuitive. Put a button at the bottom of the event detail page.

18. After moving multiple months at a time. The jsonReceivedDicts array will have all of its dictionaries be updated simultaneously (even though a specific index is given.)
    No ideas for why it would do that, it makes no sense...

NEW FEATURES!

2. Allow the event on a day area to go to other days.



Last Things To Finish:

1. Alter the names of the category buttons.

2. Adjust the preference usage to utilize strings instead of ints.

3. Finish the hub.
